Additional Comments:

Well done! You did a really good job of matching the style of your site to the mock you were given, with the lines and bullets and everything.

A few of your tags are mismatched, like <h5>Overthrow</h4>. Probably just a typo, but watch out for that.

Make sure not to repeat ids. So like how you have: <section id="section"></section> several times. (It works, but it's not semantic.) For something like that, you can use a class instead. (I know we talked about this in class after the homework was turned in, so you probably got the hang of it by now.)

Overall, great job. Let me know if you have any questions.
