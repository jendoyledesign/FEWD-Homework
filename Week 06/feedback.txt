Create an array with the following values: "NYC", "SF", "LA", "ATX", "SYD"; use the array to add values to the <select> menu by using a for loop in JavaScript (don't update the HTML to do this!)
 - Good!
When the user changes the input of the drop-down, update the background image based on what they selected
 - Good!
Use $.append() in your iteration on the drop-down menu
 - Good! But the HTML you're passing into .append() isn't quite right. You're missing the '/' in your closing tag. That's causing some strange behavior in your dropdown.
Use the $.attr() function to update html classes
 - Good!
Get the value of user input using $.val()
 - Good!
Use the $.change event handler to capture user actions
 - Good!
Use if/else if/else conditionals to control the flow of your application
 - Good!
Display your pseudocode as Javascript comments
 - Good!

 Additional Comments:

 - Good job! The functionality is all there and your javascript is well indented.

 - You're already declaring the variable 'city' using the 'var' keyword on line 3. You don't need to use the 'var' keyword again on line 16.
