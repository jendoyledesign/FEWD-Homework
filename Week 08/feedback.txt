Additional Feedback

 - Good job with the styling, placeholder text, and variety of input elements!

 - Some of your attributes aren't quite right. I see several elements like this: "<input type='name' text='text'". What you were going for was "<input type='text'". 'text' happens to be the default value, which is why it works anyway.
